# Raw MS Data

## Introduction

Sometimes it is useful to look at your raw MS data, like the chromatography runs, the number of peaks per spectrum or something else like the isolation window boundaries for your DIA MS2 spectra. Much of manual evaluation of LC-MS data is done with Thermo [Xcalibur](https://www.thermofisher.com/de/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/lc-ms-data-acquisition-software/xcalibur-data-acquisition-interpretation-software.html) or [OpenMS](https://openms.de/), however they do not allow you to script a specific task. For this, we can load our raw MS data into R and do it ourselves.
