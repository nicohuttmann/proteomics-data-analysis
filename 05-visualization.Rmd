# Interactive Data Analysis

## Quick example

A non-app interactive Volcano plot that connects to its original data:

- interactive plot via `ggplot2` and `plotly`
- connection between plot and table via `crosstalk` ([check it out](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/index.html))
- canvas to put both together with `bslib`


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(crosstalk)
library(bslib)
library(DT)

# Our data
data <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, 3), 
               y = c(1, 2, 3), 
               gene = c("A", "B", "C"))

# Plot 
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, gene = gene)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic()

# Shared data object 
data_plot <- SharedData$new(data = data, 
                            key = ~gene)

# Initial plot 
p <- data_plot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, gene = gene)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic()

# Make plot interactive 
ggplotly(p)

# Put all together 
page_fillable(ggplotly(p), 
              datatable(data_plot, selection = "single"))

```
